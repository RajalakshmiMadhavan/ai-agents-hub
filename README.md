# ai-agents-hub
Developing AI Agents is a collection of experiments, tools, and applications that showcase how to build intelligent agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Ollama, GPT, and other open-source models.

**This repo explores:**
🤖 Single-agent apps — autonomous AI agents that perform specific tasks (e.g., productivity coach, travel planner, email assistant).
🧠 Reasoning patterns — chain-of-thought, self-reflection, tree-of-thoughts, and decision-making logics.
👥 Multi-agent systems — agents that collaborate, debate, or simulate environments.
🎛️ Integrations — lightweight apps built with Python + Streamlit, showing real-world AI workflows.

The goal of this repo is to serve as a learning hub and playground for experimenting with AI agents, covering both practical applications and core logic development.
